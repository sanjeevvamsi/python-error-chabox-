# ChatBot

This was a Python ErrorSolver ChatBot. 
I have developed it using python and its modules.
Type your errors in it and it will display an optimal solution for it.
Most of the regular errors are pre-defined and the remaining were directed to the stackoverflow.

This was an open source project and you were provided copyrights about it so that you can use it for your personal purpose or can change its code to make a better version of it.
If anyone have a better working idea to this code kindly contact me and i'm happy to work about it.
